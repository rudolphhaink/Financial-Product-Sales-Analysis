# 🏦 Banking Sales Analysis: Marketing Performance, Revenue & Churn (2021-2023)

This project explores a fictional banking sales dataset spanning three years (2019–2021), with the goal of uncovering relationships between marketing spend, revenue generation, and customer churn across different regions and product types.

The analysis is performed in **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** and is complemented by a **Tableau dashboard** for interactive exploration.

## 📊 Project Objectives

- Analyze customer acquisition and churn trends over time.
- Investigate the impact of marketing spend on revenue.
- Explore how relationships vary across:
  - Regions
  - Product names and categories
- Visualize insights and patterns to support strategic decision-making.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- **Python**: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `numpy`
- **Jupyter Notebook**: for interactive exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- **Tableau**: for dynamic dashboards and stakeholder-ready insights

## 📌 Insights Summary

- **Regional & product-level variation** is high—suggesting that performance depends heavily on context.
- **Marketing-Revenue correlation** is positive in some cases, but weak or absent in others.
- **Churn impact** appears decoupled from marketing in many segments.
- A one-size-fits-all prediction model may not be suitable without segmentation.
